Question 3

What are registers?

Answer:

	Registers are memory cells placed directly on the CPU chip. Circuit-wise they are much faster, but they are also more
complicated and expensive. Register accesses do not use the bus. The response time is quite small and usually equals a couple of CPU
cycles.
